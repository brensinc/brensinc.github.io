                    <div class="block-description">
                        <p>With electricity demand increasing thanks to electrification and the renewable energy revolution, our society is 
                            increasingly dependent on the electric grid. However, this transition makes cyberattacks on the grid a threat with 
                            catastrophic implications. In this assignment for EECS 127, I modeled an electric grid using vertices as substations 
                            and edges as power lines. I then placed sensors at points throughout the power system and chose a subset of sensors to 
                            be attacked with a random offset value. Formulating and solving a <strong>LASSO optimization problem</strong>, I was 
                            able to correctly identify every modified sensor in the system <strong>95%</strong> of the time. Not bad for a first 
                            try at protecting our national power system from cyberattacks!

                    <div class="block-description">
                        <p>Have you ever stepped out of your door to head to the airport, looked up at the sky, and thought, “Is my flight going to 
                            leave on time today?” Thankfully very few of us have to fly out of Chicago Midway Airport regularly, so we rarely <em>expect</em>
                            delays. However, the relative infrequency of delayed flights means that accuracy wouldn’t be the most appropriate measure. Instead, 
                            we should evaluate our model performance based on the ROC AUC, representing the relationship between a model’s True Positive 
                            Rate and False Positive Rate. In this project, I created a <strong>preprocessing pipeline</strong> that incorporates one-hot encoding, 
                            feature aggregation, and low-frequency handling, optimizing data for input into a <strong>random forest classifier</strong>. 
                            I achieved <strong>71% ROC AUC</strong> in predicting flight delays exceeding 15 minutes by engineering features from external 
                            airport metadata, including region, international status, and elevation. <br>

                    <div class="block-description">
                        <p>Forecasting consumer demand is an essential function in running a grocery store chain. Effective forecasting saves companies 
                            money by minimizing excess expenditure and it reduces the overstocking that contributes to food waste. <br>
                            This project focuses on predicting store sales using a <strong>random forest</strong> model enhanced by 
                            <strong>advanced feature engineering</strong>. Fourier terms were used to model seasonality, while lagged sales data captured 
                            temporal dependencies, and decomposition techniques improved accuracy by isolating trend and residual components. Exploratory 
                            data analysis, including periodograms and autocorrelation plots, identified key seasonal patterns and lag relationships, 
                            guiding feature selection. The final model effectively captures non-linear interactions, providing reliable forecasts to inform
                            inventory decisions.<br>

                        <p>This project involved designing and training <strong>Neural

                            to build a deep understanding of their architectures and 
                            functionality. Key tasks included implementing vectorized 
                            backpropagation, optimizing models with advanced update 
                            rules, and enhancing training with techniques like batch 
                            normalization and dropout. Hyperparameter tuning through 
                            cross-validation refined model performance, while 
                            convolutional architectures were developed to handle 
                            image-related tasks. The project culminated in using PyTorch 
                            to train and evaluate models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, 
                            combining theoretical learning with practical application to

                        <h3>MySQL Database Using Temperature/Humidity Sensor</h3>

                    <div class="block-description">
                        <p>Most normal people who want to practice working with SQL databases go online and find data to use, but anyone who has taken EECS 16A/B knows that data is everywhere. Frankly, why would I want to use someone else’s data when I can collect some for myself? So I pulled out my Arduino Uno R3 and a DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor and implemented a system that collects humidity and temperature data from my bedroom and adds it to a MySQL database. <br>

                            This project involved reading humidity and temperature data from my sensor to the serial monitor. Afterward, I wrote a Python script using pySerial and MySQL Connector to continuously send data from the serial monitor to my database. To monitor the status of my room, I set the program up to send me Discord notifications when the room temperature is outside of my desired range. <br>
                            The only drawback to the system I created is that my Arduino doesn’t have wireless capabilities, so it has to be plugged into a computer for the data to be read. My plans are to do a similar project with a different microcontroller that works wirelessly and to incorporate a dashboard to visualize the sensor readings. <br>
                            
                            Regardless, I finally have some data to play around with!

                        <p>Whether you worship or constantly complain about them, you cannot deny the importance of batteries in modern life. But very few people understand battery 
                            electrochemistry and even fewer have developed great models for simulating a battery’s <strong>State of Charge</strong> (SOC) and <strong>State of Health</strong> (SOH) dynamics. The 
                            purpose of this project is not to become one of those experts but to draw from their publications to better understand the <em>really big</em> questions 
                            such as <em> Why does my 2015 MacBook Air die at 20% SOC?</em> <br>

                            This project defines battery objects and draws from the scientific literature to simulate, monitor, and analyze a battery's SOC and SOH in Python. It has 
                            electro-thermal modeling for performance and SOC analysis and an interactive <strong>Dash</strong> dashboard for visualization. Additionally, the system 
                            integrates Discord notifications to alert users about critical battery states such as excess discharge.<br>
